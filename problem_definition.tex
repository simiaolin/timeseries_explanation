\section{describe interpretable properties for each cluster in the context of time series}
\section{obtain an interpretable comparison between different clusters [also mention in timeseries, correct and precise! always remember that accessors are not familiar with your topic as well as the terms]}

\subsection{An item}
A master's thesis is never an isolated work. This means that your text must
contain references. On-line documents\cite{wiki} as well as
books\cite{pratchett06:_good_omens} can be referenced.


\section{Lorem Ipsum}
This section is added to check headers and footers. So this chapter must at
least contain three pages. To make sure that we get the required amount,
the \textsf{lipsum} package isn't used but the text is put directly in the
text.
