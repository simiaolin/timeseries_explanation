\section{describe interpretable properties for each cluster in the context of time series}
\section{obtain an interpretable comparison between different clusters [also mention in timeseries, correct and precise! always remember that accessors are not familiar with your topic as well as the terms]}
\section{explain why given time series appear in the same cluster or fall into different clusters [in semi supervised timeseries clustering]}


\subsection{An item}
A master's thesis is never an isolated work. This means that your text must
contain references. On-line documents\cite{wiki} as well as
books\cite{pratchett06:_good_omens} can be referenced.

\section{Figures}
Figures are used to add illustrations to the text. The \fref{fig:logo} shows
the KU~Leuven logo as an illustration.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{logokul}
	\caption{The KU~Leuven logo.}
	\label{fig:logo}
\end{figure}

\section{Tables}
Tables are used to present data neatly arranged. A table is normally
not a spreadsheet! Compare \tref{tab:wrong} en \tref{tab:ok}: which table do
you prefer?

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{||l|lr||} \hline
		gnats     & gram      & \$13.65 \\ \cline{2-3}
		& each      & .01 \\ \hline
		gnu       & stuffed   & 92.50 \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-3}
		emu       &           & 33.33 \\ \hline
		armadillo & frozen    & 8.99 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{A table with the wrong layout.}
	\label{tab:wrong}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{@{}llr@{}} \toprule
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{Item} \\ \cmidrule(r){1-2}
		Animal    & Description & Price (\$)\\ \midrule
		Gnat      & per gram    & 13.65 \\
		& each        & 0.01 \\
		Gnu       & stuffed     & 92.50 \\
		Emu       & stuffed     & 33.33 \\
		Armadillo & frozen      & 8.99 \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{A table with the correct layout.}
	\label{tab:ok}
\end{table}

\section{Lorem Ipsum}
This section is added to check headers and footers. So this chapter must at
least contain three pages. To make sure that we get the required amount,
the \textsf{lipsum} package isn't used but the text is put directly in the
text.
