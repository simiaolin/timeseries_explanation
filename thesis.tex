\begin{preface}
Throughout the writing of this thesis I have received a great deal of support and assistance.

I would first like to thank my advisor, Aras Yurtman. You are always so supportive and patient. I learn a lot on how to conduct a research from you on our weekly meeting. I could not have completed this thesis without advice and encouragement you give me all the time. 

I would also like to acknowledge my supervisors, Wannes Meert and Prof. Hendrik Blockeel,  whose expertise was invaluable in formulating the research questions and methodology. 

In addition, I would like to thank my accessors for reading the text.

Finally, my gratitude also goes to my family for their sympathetic ear. You are always there resting my mind outside the research.

\begin{abstract}
 Many applications of machine learning involve time series data (e.g. sensor measurements). An approach that has been successfully applied in the DTAI research group is \texttt{COBRAS-TS}, a semi-supervised time series clustering to detect novel patterns or features. Such features can then be used in applications such as anomaly detection or prognostics.

An important aspect of applying machine learning models to real-world use cases is interpretability. These novel features need to be explained or shown to domain experts. In this thesis I make use of the Dynamic Time Warping (\texttt{DTW}) distance measure, \texttt{DTW} barycenter averaging(\texttt{DBA}) and contraints from   \texttt{COBRAS-TS}   to summarize why a set of time series are clustered together and how one cluster differs from other clusters.
