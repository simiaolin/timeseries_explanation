\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
The goal of semi-supervised learning is to combine the opinions of experts with existing information. COBRAS \cite{van2018cobras} the most query-efficient semi-supervised clustering method. It has a time series-based version, COBRAS-TS \cite{van2018cobrasts}.  Clustering time series data can be of significant value in several scenarios in our daily life, such as clustering on the energy consumption data, electrocardiogram data, etc. However, how the clustering result is obtained is a black box or at least a gray box to end-users. The resulting clustering is difficult to interpret and evaluate, especially for large datasets. This is a significant drawback for semi-supervised systems where experts can contribute to the result but are unable to interpret or evaluate it. We study here how the semi-supervised clustering result can be explained and interpreted. Two benefits are doing so. Apart from providing end-users a more intuitive way of understanding the result, one can convince the experts who give opinions during the clustering process that the result is truly partly based on their knowledge.

\textbf{DTW.} Unlike Euclidean distance, DTW \cite{senin2008dynamic} computes the best possible alignment between two time series of respective lengths $  n $ and  $  m $  by first computing the $ n * m $ pairwise distance matrix between these points and then solving a dynamic program. The most important characteristic of DTW is its invariance against warping in the time axis. It can capture alternations between leading and lagging relationships of time series.  In other words, if two time series have similar trends but do not correspond to each other in the time axis, DTW will do a warping, making sure that similar trends inside them are mapped to each other. 

\textbf{DBA.} Averaging on time series data is different. DBA does not calculate the average by the Euclidean distance. Instead, it uses the DTW mentioned above. Compared to the arithmetic mean, DBA \cite{petitjean2011global} preserves the ability of DTW, identifying time shifts. 

\textbf{COBRA.} COBRA \cite{vancraenendonck2018cobra} is a constraint-based semi-supervised clustering method. It allows users to give feedback on the relationship of instances. By introducing the concept of \textbf{super-instance} which are a group of similar instances, and only execute queries on the super-instance, COBRA can substantially reduce the number of queries, which makes it query-efficient.

\textbf{COBRAS.} COBRAS \cite{van2018cobras} is designed to automatically form clusters of better granularity. It refines COBRA by giving chance to split super-instances after they are formed. COBRAS beats COBRA for its ability to converge to clustering with better-grained levels of granularity in a shorter time with fewer queries. 

\textbf{COBRAS-TS.} COBRAS-TS \cite{van2018cobrasts} is COBRAS with respect to time series.

\textbf{Our contributions.} We mainly provide two new ways to explain the time series clustering. One is to show the properties of time series instances inside one cluster. We mainly show the average and the deviation. To better show the alignment information of DTW, we propose warping deviation. The other is to show the relationship entailment between two specific instances with constraint information provided by users to explain why they have been clustered together or apart.

\textbf{Structure}. After providing background material in chapter \ref{cha:related_work} and problem definition in chapter \ref{cha:problem_definition}, We introduce in chapter \ref{cha:properties_of_a_cluster} different types of deviation for time series instances in one cluster. We follow in chapter \ref{cha:cluster_membership}  illustrating the relationship entailment between two time series instances with the help of constraints provided by users. We close this paper in chapter \ref{cha:conclusion} with the pros and cons of my ways of explaining time-series clusters and show potential applications.
